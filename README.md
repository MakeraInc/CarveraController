### Install Windows USB Driver (if you connect the machine via USB)

After connecting the USB into your computer. Then open the device manager and under the **Other devices** tab you should see it as **FTDI 232R UART**. If it shows up there correctly then follow the steps from **"STEP 1"**. And if it shows up as **USB Serial Port**. In that case simply follow the steps from **"STEP 2"**.

**Step 1: Installing First Set of USB drivers**

Firstly, Open the device manager, right click on the FTDI and click on **Update drivers**. Then click on **Browse My computer for drivers** and then just select the driver Folder where you downloaded the drivers. And then hit ok, make sure **Include Subfolder** is ticked. And now click on **Next** and it will install first set of drivers

**Step 2: Installing Second Set of USB drivers**

This time it will show up as **USB Serial Port** under **other devices**. So now again right click on it and **select update drivers**. Then again click on **Browse My computer for drivers**. And then just select the driver Folder and hit ok again, make sure **Include Subfolder** is ticked. And now click on **Next** and it will install the second set of drivers.
